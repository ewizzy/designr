# Designr - Ultimate Multi-Purpose WordPress Theme

`Designr` is an ultimate (phuck yeah) multi-purpose premium WordPress theme I used to sell on themeforest with 712 sales and average rating of 4.92 :relieved: <br />
Since I don't plan to sell premium themes anymore, I hope this theme will help new authors in building advanced WordPress themes with all possible features :partying_face: <br />
Theme uses Elementor as a page builder.

### Usage

If you're too lazy you can just open all files and search for string 'designr' and replace with your own theme name. <br />Of course, you need to build your own templates to include them in the theme. Currently available sites to import inside of theme do not work propertly because of multiple critical updates in Elementor after theme is built but code is still valid, just don't look good :) <br />I guess you don't plan to sell my designs as yours, do you? :raised_eyebrow:	:expressionless: :zany_face:
